Purpouse of this project is to create playlists by user data and input.
Currently it works by:
1. Getting users most listened 100 songs
2. Getting playlist name, description and wanted mood.
3. Gets recomended songs.
4. Filters those songs by mood.
5. Creates a new playlist and prints it out.

In the future i plan to implement new ways of generating playlists and make this a website.
